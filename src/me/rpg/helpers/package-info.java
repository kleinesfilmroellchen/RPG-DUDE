/**
 * A helper package containing:
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>Functions, calculations and algorithms
 * 			that will be integrated into other classes eventually.
 * 			Those are in the <code>Functions</code> class.</li>
 * 		<li>Whole classes that are part of the project. They do stuff not entirely related to core gameplay, but are useful in special areas.</li>
 * 		<li>Classes that provide project-independent utillity, such as {@code BetterRandom} and {@code BetterMath}. Could actually be used in other projects, as well.</li>
 * </ul>
