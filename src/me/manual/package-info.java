/**
 * A Package for all the manual-related classes.
 * The manual is opened by supplying the command line argument {@code manual} at least once.
 * This openes the manual instead of the game.
 * The manual is fully independent from the main game; it is only called by the RPG_MAIN method in case of the argument.
 * 
 * @author kleinesfilmröllchen
 * @version 0.0.0008
 * @since 0.0.0008
