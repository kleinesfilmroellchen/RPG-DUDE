# RPG-DUDE
Text-based RPG written in Java.

Created by @kleinesfilmroellchen and DJH as a freetime project.

__Note: all of the menu and manual is currently in German. At some point we might translate it into English, but this is not planned currently.__

The most recent version is 0.0.0008a, with "a" standing for Alpha.

A changelog in German can be found in the ```CHANGELOG.txt``` file.

Instructions on how to run the game and information about command line arguments (all German) can be found in the ```LIESMICH.txt``` file.
